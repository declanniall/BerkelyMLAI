To summarize the findings Of Bar Coupons

    The total rate of acceptance across all coupons is 0.5693352098683666. Proportion of bar coupons that were accepted against those offered was 0.41191845269210664

    The acceptance rate between those who went to a bar 3 or fewer times a month to those who went more is 0.2953020134228188 vs 0.7616580310880829

    The acceptance rate between drivers who go to a bar more than once a month and are over the age of 25 to the all others 0.7 vs 0.4073287307488051

    Acceptance rate of drivers who go to bars more than once a month and had passengers that were not a kid and had occupations other than farming, fishing, or forestry is 0.7111111111111111. Acceptance rate of drivers who who are not in above category is 0.40471092077087795

    Acceptance rate of drivers who go to bars more than once a month, had passengers that were not a kid, and were not widowed is 0.6842105263157895

    Acceptance rate of drivers who go to bars more than once a month and are under the age of 30 is 0.8333333333333334

    Acceptance rate of drivers who go to cheap restaurants more than 4 times a month and income is less than 50K is 0.45645645645645644

Conclusions

Bar coupons are selected about 40% of the time when they are issued. I presume the business objective is to target the coupons more accurately, to get the acceptance rate up. looking at the data I would do this by

    Only issuing coupons to people who go to bars more than 3 times a month
    Issue more coupons to those between the ages of 25 and 30

It is interesting that those with lower income and eat more at cheaper restaurants do not use bar coupons much more than the average. Which indicates income level is not a factor for bar coupon use.

To summarize the findings Of Coffee Coupons

Proportion of Coffee coupons that were accepted against those offered was 0.49633123689727465

When broken down by income level, accceptance rate of drivers whose income between

87499 is 0.2982456140350877

In order to investigate why this is, I looked at the acceptance rate at each factor that I thought could have a bearing for people within this range. The reults that stood out were: - The acceptance rate for those with no particular destination was high compared to those going to work - The acceptance rate is high when it is sunny and temperature over 80 degrees - The acceptance rate is high when at 10am and 2pm - The acceptance rate is high when they are married and have a graduate degree - The acceptance rate is high when they have 4-8 coffeeeshop visits a month - Surprisingly distance to coffee shop or if in direction of travel does not seem to make too much difference.

Finally, having dug down into the data for this income group, I examined if filtering above across all income levels could significantly increase acceptance rate.

- Acceptance rate when it is good weather and time either 10AM and 2PM, and person not on way to work 0.5891472868217055
- Acceptance rate when it is good weather and time either 10AM and 2PM, and person not on way to work and go to Coffeehouse 4 or more times 0.7673469387755102

Conclusions

It seems thate the dominating factor for coffeehouse coupon usage is how often a person goes to a coffeehouse and acceptance rate gets higher than average if they go 4 or more times in a month. Also, time of day and weather have an impact. It may be that Marital Status and Education level could also have an impact, but it would be a tricky road for a business to go down to discriminate coupon distribution to those demographics.
